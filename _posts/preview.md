## Marissa Calderon
I really enjoyed my Intro to Computer Science class this semester. I am grateful to Professor Fonseca for being so informative and friendly. His lessons were interactive and fun, and he made everything easy to understand. I recommend this class to any student wanting to begin their journey in this industry. I will be taking his Computer Science I class this Fall if everything goes according to plan. My favorite part about Computer Science was learning about programming and learning how a computer understands data. I also liked learning how the process of creating an algorithm is a lot like solving a problem with different steps, and the qualities that will make a good program. 

As for my future in the Computer Science industry, I’m still undecided. I initially thought I’d like to be a data engineer, but the possibilities are so vast that I may change my direction. I’m interested in data analysis, cyber security, game development, or maybe even teaching! It was nice to learn that there are so many careers in this industry, and I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to learn. I am returning to college after 15 years with intent to become part of something bigger, and I know Computer Science is here for the foreseeable future.
