## Marissa Calderon
I really enjoyed my Intro to Computer Science class this semester. I am grateful to Professor Fonseca for being so informative and friendly. His lessons were interactive and fun, and he made everything easy to understand. I recommend this class to any student wanting to begin their journey in this industry. I will be taking his Computer Science I class this Fall if everything goes according to plan. My favorite part about Computer Science was learning about programming and learning how a computer understands data. I also liked learning how the process of creating an algorithm is a lot like solving a problem with different steps, and the qualities that will make a good program. 

As for my future in the Computer Science industry, I’m still undecided. I initially thought I’d like to be a data engineer, but the possibilities are so vast that I may change my direction. I’m interested in data analysis, cyber security, game development, or maybe even teaching! It was nice to learn that there are so many careers in this industry, and I sincerely appreciate the opportunity to learn. I am returning to college after 15 years with intent to become part of something bigger, and I know Computer Science is here for the foreseeable future.

My journey with Computer Science started when I was young, so much that is essentially want influenced my major. So being able to take Intro to Computer Science this semester, I was able to learn more that I already had previously as well as improving small areas taht I already known. Learning new things that I have not previously known like HTML coding (introduction) and whatPseudocode is, it has expanded my perspective and to really see waht Computer Science is really about. My career goal so far is that I am determine to obtain my Bachelor's degree in Spring 2028. Intro to computer science is not the only class I took this semester, I also took Computer Science I with another professor at the samee time, so having both classes really help me furthert understand the language.

As to how everything started, it goes back to my household environment where I would always try to fix my owen things due to making last longer. How is this related to Computer Science? It was to do with my experience with electronics. Fixing electronics back then was not easy as to I couldn't get part replacements and had limited tools, so it was challenging. but over time, I had learn to fix cellphones, computers and laptops, video game consoles and their controllers, and even larger electronics like washing machines. But now I want to focus in learning how to create and fix electronics digitally; to further discover more possibilities to innovate new and existing electronics. I believe that eveyone has their start and ending, but the journey is shared when we are pasiotane to complete something with our hands. Mine is to create innovations to help others and make machinery more efficient. With that in mind, what is your story and how do you plan to accomplish it?
